Just walked out of the theater after seeing Inception, and wow, my brain feels like a scrambled Rubik's cube. First off, who thought it was a good idea to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 this   after a long day? My eyes are begging for mercy, but here I am, riding the wave of confusion and brilliance without any warning.

The   starts and bam, you're already 10 layers deep into Leonardo DiCaprio’s wrinkled dream face — not quite how I planned spending my Thursday night. Is this a good time to say that a nap might’ve been a better option? But, really, how is Leo still on top of his game? The man navigates dream worlds like he’s on some intense virtual reality diet. Kudos to him. 

Then there’s this whole dream-within-a-dream thing. It’s like folding a taco inside a burrito — ambitious, weird, but somehow you keep eating. And let’s talk layers. You mean to tell me there’s a storyline in my popcorn box too? Because it sure feels like it. I admit, at some point, I was wondering if my dreams looked that cool, or if I just get stuck in the lame ones where I lose my socks. Christopher Nolan, you sly dog, you probably sleep in technicolor IMAX.

> Don’t even get me started on that spinning top. WHAT? Is it still spinning or did I blink and miss the point? If I have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 that   again to check, I swear... It's like Dora the Explorer for adults, and every time someone said “Inception,” I half-expected a talking map to appear. Seriously though, on what planet did they draw that inspiration from? Mars? Venus? Some intergalactic dream planet where physics is just a suggestion?

And about halfway in, I’m convinced this is less a   and more a life altering thesis on napping. I mean, isn’t inception just the fanciest way of saying snooze button? One day we’re all gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to learn the magical art of sleeping through a heist and call it personal development.

some_function = lambda x: spin if x%2 == 0 else fall
print(some_function(5)) # No idea why I added this, blame Nolan.

But for real, underneath my sleep-deprived dramatics, it was one heck of a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 experience. It’ll probably take a week for my mind to settle back into reality — or maybe I’m still inside someone else’s dream as I’m typing this. Who knows? Okay, I should probably just stop trying to sound profound and think about ice cream or cats instead. Go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you haven’t yet. Just... maybe not right before bed.
